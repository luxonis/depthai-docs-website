Windows 7
---------

Although we do not officially support Windows 7, members of the community `have
had success <https://discuss.luxonis.com/d/105-run-on-win7-sp1-x64-manual-instal-usb-driver>`__ manually installing WinUSB using `Zadig
<https://zadig.akeo.ie/>`__. After connecting your DepthAI device look for a
device with :code:`USB ID: 03E7 2485` and install the WinUSB driver by
selecting `WinUSB(v6.1.7600.16385)` and then `Install WCID Driver`.

Install from PyPI
#################

Our packages are distributed `via PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/depthai/>`__, to install it in your environment use

.. code-block:: bash

  python3 -m pip install depthai

For other installation options, see :ref:`other installation options <Other installation methods>`.

Test installation
#################

We have `depthai <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai>`__ repository on our GitHub that contains many helpful examples and
prepared neural networks you can use to make your prototyping faster. It also includes the test script, maintained by
our contributors, that should help you verify if your setup was correct.

First, clone the `depthai <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai>`__ repository and change directory into this repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/luxonis/depthai.git
  cd depthai

Next install the requirements for this repository.
Note that we recommend installing the dependencies in a virtual environment, so that they don't interfere with other Python
tools/environments on your system. 

- For development machines like Mac/Windows/Ubuntu/etc., we recommend the `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__ IDE, as it automatically makes/manages virtual environments for you, along with a bunch of other benefits.  Alternatively, `conda`, `pipenv`, or `virtualenv` could be used directly (and/or with your preferred IDE).  
- For installations on resource-constrained systems, such as the Raspberry Pi or other small Linux systems, we recommend `conda`, `pipenv`, or `virtualenv`.  To set up a virtual environment with `virtualenv`, run `virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate`.  

Using a virtual environment (or system-wide, if you prefer), run the following to install the requirements for this example repository:

.. code-block:: bash

  python3 install_requirements.py

Now, run the demo script from within depthai to make sure everything is working:

.. code-block:: bash

  python3 depthai_demo.py

If all goes well a small window video display with overlays for any items for which the class exists in the example
20-class object detector (class list `here <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai/blob/master/resources/nn/mobilenet-ssd/mobilenet-ssd.json#L22>`__).


Run Other Examples
##################

After you have run this demo, you can either run :code:`python3 depthai_demo.py -h` to see other neural networks that by-default can be run.

After checking this out, proceed to:

- Our tutorials, starting with how to use pre-trained neural models from OpenVINO, `HERE <https://docs.luxonis.com/en/latest/pages/tutorials/pretrained_openvino/>`__
- Our experiments `HERE <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-experiments>`__ to learn more ways to use DepthAI.  

You can also proceed below to learn how to convert your own neural networks to run on DepthAI.  

And we also have online model training below, which shows you how to train and convert models for DepthAI:

- Online ML Training and model Conversion: `HERE <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-ml-training/tree/master/colab-notebooks>`__ 

Preparing Myriad X blob and configuration file
##############################################

As you can see in `example`_, basic usage of :func:`Device.create_pipeline` method consists of specifying desired output
streams and AI section, where you specify Myriad X blob and it's configuration
file.

In this section, we'll describe how to obtain both :code:`blob_file` and :code:`blob_file_config`.

Obtaining Myriad X blob
***********************

Since we're utilizing Myriad X VPU, your model needs to be compiled (or accurately - optimized and converted) into
the Myriad X blob file, which will be sent to the device and executed.

Easiest way to obtain this blob is to use our `online BlobConverter app <http://69.164.214.171:8083/>`__. It has all
tools needed for compilation so you don't need to setup anything - and you can even download a blob for the model
from `OpenVINO model zoo <https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/open_model_zoo>`__.

If you'd like, you can also compile the blob yourself. You'll need to install `OpenVINO toolkit <https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/index.html>`__,
then use `Model Optimizer <https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_docs_MO_DG_Deep_Learning_Model_Optimizer_DevGuide.html>`__ and `Myriad Compiler <https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/openvino_inference_engine_tools_compile_tool_README.html#myriad_platform_option>`__
in order to obtain Myriad X blob.
We've documented example usage of these compilers `here <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai#conversion-of-existing-trained-models-into-intel-movidius-binary-format>`__

Creating Blob configuration file
********************************

If configuration file is not provided or :code:`output_format` is set to :code:`raw`, no decoding is done on device and user must do it manually on host side.

Currently there is support to decode :code:`Mobilenet-SSD` and :code:`(tiny-)YOLO-v3` based networks on the device.
For that configuration file is required with network specific parameters.

Example for `tiny-yolo-v3` network:

.. code-block:: json

  {
      "NN_config":
      {
          "output_format" : "detection",
          "NN_family" : "YOLO",
          "NN_specific_metadata" :
          {
              "classes" : 80,
              "coordinates" : 4,
              "anchors" : [10,14, 23,27, 37,58, 81,82, 135,169, 344,319],
              "anchor_masks" :
              {
                  "side26" : [1,2,3],
                  "side13" : [3,4,5]
              },
              "iou_threshold" : 0.5,
              "confidence_threshold" : 0.5
          }
      },
      "mappings":
      {
          "labels":
          [
              "person",
              "bicycle",
              "car",
              "..."
          ]
      }
  }


* :code:`NN_config` - configuration for the network
    * :code:`output_format`
        * :code:`"detection"` - decoding done on device, the received packet is in :class:`Detections` format
        * :code:`"raw"` - decoding done on host
    * :code:`NN_family` - `"YOLO"` or `"mobilenet"`
    * :code:`NN_specific_metadata` - only for `"YOLO"`
        * :code:`classes` - number of classes
        * :code:`coordinates` - number of coordinates
        * :code:`anchors` - anchors for YOLO network
        * :code:`anchor_masks` - anchor mask for each output layer : :code:`26x26`, :code`13x13` (+ `52x52` for full YOLO-v3)
        * :code:`iou_threshold` - intersection over union threshold for detected object
        * :code:`confidence_threshold` - score confidence threshold for detected object
* :code:`mappings.labels` - used by :code:`depthai_demo.py` script to decode labels from id's

Example decoding when :code:`output_format` is set to :code:`detection`:

.. code-block:: python

  nnet_packets, data_packets = p.get_available_nnet_and_data_packets()

  for nnet_packet in nnet_packets:
    in_layers = nnet_packet.getInputLayersInfo()

    input_width  = in_layers[0].get_dimension(depthai.TensorInfo.Dimension.W)
    input_height = in_layers[0].get_dimension(depthai.TensorInfo.Dimension.H)

    detections = nnet_packet.getDetectedObjects()
    objects = list()

    for detection in detections:
        detection_dict = detection.get_dict()
        # scale normalized coordinates to image coordinates
        detection_dict["x_min"] = int(detection_dict["x_min"] * input_width)
        detection_dict["y_min"] = int(detection_dict["y_min"] * input_height)
        detection_dict["x_max"] = int(detection_dict["x_max"] * input_width)
        detection_dict["y_max"] = int(detection_dict["y_max"] * input_height)
        objects.append(detection_dict)

  print(objects)

Example of decoding for full :code:`yolo-v3` and :code:`tiny-yolo-v3` on host and device is `here <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai/blob/develop/depthai_helpers/tiny_yolo_v3_handler.py>`__


Example of decoding for :code:`mobilenet` based networks on host and device is `here <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai/blob/develop/depthai_helpers/mobilenet_ssd_handler.py>`__


Other installation methods
##########################

To get the latest and yet unreleased features from our source code, you can go ahead and compile depthai package manually.

Dependencies to build from source
*********************************

- CMake > 3.2.0
- Generation tool (Ninja, make, ...)
- C/C++ compiler
- libusb1 development package

.. _raspbian:

Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, ... (Debian based systems)
---------------------------------------------------

On Debian based systems (Raspberry Pi OS, Ubuntu, ...) these can be acquired by running:

.. code-block:: bash

  sudo apt-get -y install cmake libusb-1.0-0-dev build-essential

macOS (Mac OS X)
----------------

Assuming a stock Mac OS X install, `depthai-python <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python>`__ library needs following dependencies

- Homebrew (If it's not installed already)

  .. code-block:: bash

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"

- Python, :code:`libusb`, CMake, :code:`wget`

  .. code-block:: bash

      brew install coreutils python3 cmake libusb wget

And now you're ready to clone the `depthai-python <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python>`__ from Github and build it for Mac OS X.

Install using GitHub commit
***************************

Pip allows users to install the packages from specific commits, even if they are not yet released on PyPi.

To do so, use the command below - and be sure to replace the :code:`<commit_sha>` with the correct commit hash `from here <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python/commits>`__

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python.git@<commit_sha>

Using/Testing a Specific Branch/PR
**********************************

From time to time, it may be of interest to use a specific branch.  This may occur, for example,
because we have listened to your feature request and implemented a quick implementation in a branch.
Or it could be to get early access to a feature that is soaking in our :code:`develop` for stability purposes before being merged into :code:`main`.

So when working in the `depthai <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai>`__ repository, using a branch can be accomplished
with the following commands.  For this example, the :code:`branch` that we will try out is :code:`develop`
(which is the branch we use to soak new features before merging them into :code:`main`):

Prior to running the following, you can either clone the repository independently
(for not over-writing any of your local changes) or simply do a :code:`git pull` first.

.. code-block:: bash

  git checkout develop
  python3 install_requirements.py

Install from source
*******************

If desired, you can also install the package from the source code itself - it will allow you to make the changes
to the API and see them live in action.

To do so, first download the repository and then add the package to your python interpreter in development mode

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python.git
  cd depthai-python
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  python3 setup.py develop  # you may need to add sudo if using system interpreter instead of virtual environment

If you want to use other branch (e.g. :code:`develop`) than default (:code:`main`), you can do so by typing

.. code-block:: bash

  git checkout develop  # replace the "develop" with a desired branch name
  git submodule update --recursive
  python3 setup.py develop

Or, if you want to checkout a specific commit, type

.. code-block:: bash

  git checkout <commit_sha>
  git submodule update --recursive
  python3 setup.py develop


API Reference
#############

.. class:: Device

  :canonical: depthai.Device

  Represents the DepthAI device with the methods to interact with it.

  .. warning::

    Please be aware that all methods except :func:`get_available_streams` require :func:`create_pipeline` to be run first,


  .. _example:

  **Example**

  .. code-block:: python

    import depthai
    device = depthai.Device('', False)
    pipeline = device.create_pipeline(config={
        'streams': ['previewout', 'metaout'],
        'ai': {
            "blob_file": "/path/to/model.blob",
            "blob_file_config": "/path/to/config.json",
        },
    })


  **Methods**

  .. function:: __init__(device_id: str, usb2_mode: bool) -> Device

    Standard and recommended way to set up the object.

    **device_id** represents the USB port id that the device is connected to. If set to specific value (e.x. :code:`"1"`) it will
    look for the device in specific USB port, whereas if left empty - :code:`''` - it will look for the device on all ports.
    It's useful when we have more than one DepthAI devices connected and want to specify which one to use in the code

    **usb2_mode**, being :code:`True/False`, allows the DepthAI to communicate using USB2 protocol, not USB3. This lowers the
    throughput of the pipeline, but allows to use >1m USB cables for connection

  .. function:: __init__(cmd_file: str, device_id: str) -> Device
    :noindex:

    Development and debug way to initialize the DepthAI device.

    **cmd_file** is a path to firmware :code:`.cmd` file that will be loaded onto the device for boot.

    **device_id** represents the USB port id that the device is connected to. If set to specific value (e.x. :code:`"1"`) it will
    look for the device in specific USB port, whereas if left empty - :code:`''` - it will look for the device on all ports.
    It's useful when we have more than one DepthAI devices connected and want to specify which one to use in the code

  .. function:: create_pipeline(config: dict) -> depthai.CNNPipeline

    Initializes a DepthAI Pipeline, returning the created :code:`CNNPipeline` if successful and :code:`None` otherwise.

    **config(dict)** -  A :code:`dict` of pipeline configuration settings. Example key/values for the config:

    .. code-block:: python

  .. function:: get_nn_to_depth_bbox_mapping() -> dict

    Returns dict that allows to match the CNN output with the disparity info.

    Since the RGB camera has a 4K resolution and the neural networks accept only images with specific resolution

    On the other side, the disparity frames returned by the neural network are in full resolution available on the mono cameras.

    To be able to determine where the CNN previewout image is on the disparity frame, this method should be used as it
    specifies the offsets and dimensions to use.
