The Raspberry Pi Compute Module Edition comes with everything needed: pre-calibrated stereo cameras on-board with a 4K,
60 Hz color camera and a µSD card with Raspbian and DepthAI Python code automatically running on bootup.
This allows using the power of DepthAI with literally no typing or even clicking: it just boots up doing its thing.
Then you can modify the Python code with one-line changes, replacing the neural model for the objects you would like to localize.

- Built-in RaspberryPi Compute Module
- Three integrated cameras
- Complete system; everything you need is included

What's in the box?
******************

- BW1097 Carrier Board
- Pre-flashed µSD card loaded with Raspbian 10 and DepthAI

  - Default Password: :code:`luxonis`

- WiFI USB dongle
- Power Supply

Setup
*****

To get started:

#. **Connect a display to the HDMI port.**

    Note that an HDMI cable is not included.

#. **Connect a keyboard and mouse via the USB port**
#. **Connect the power supply (included).**

    On boot, the Pi will run `a Python demo script <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai/blob/main/depthai_demo.py>`__ that displays a video stream annotated with object localization metadata:

    In the screenshot above, DepthAI identified a tv monitor (1.286 m from the camera) and a chair (3.711 m from the camera).
    See `the list of object labels <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai/blob/main/resources/nn/mobilenet-ssd/mobilenet-ssd.json#L10>`__ on GitHub.

#. **Connect to the Internet.**

    Connect the Pi to the Internet to begin trying the DepthAI tutorials and examples.

    * **Connecting to a WiFi network**

        To connect to a WiFi network, use the included Linux-compatible USB WiFi dongle.
        The Pi should recognize the dongle and display available WiFi networks in the upper right corner of the Raspbian Desktop UI.

    * **Connecting to a network via Ethernet**

        The board includes an Ethernet port. Connecting an Ethernet cable to the port will enable Internet access.

#. **Run example script**.

  See :ref:`Verify installation`

[Optional] Using your own SD-Card
*********************************

If you'd like to set up DetphAI on your own (say bigger) SD-Card, there are two options:

#.  Download our pre-configured Raspbian image for the BW1097 (the Raspberry Pi Compute Module Edition), here: `BW1097 Raspian Image <https://drive.google.com/open?id=19JRcRkdmiJ96lsoMdCu2_zbbYrSG7wsu>`__. Then, after downloading, update the DepthAI firmware/software (by doing a git pull on the DepthAI code base checked out on the Desktop).
#.  Set up your own Raspbian to your liking from say a fresh Raspbian download, and then use replace dt-blob.bin and config.txt in /boot with the following two files:

    - `dt-blob.bin <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OarNtX58YUtVcqHog8NnnCWmCgYpN-z_>`__ - For enabling the Pi MIPI display
    - `config.txt <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1cg8OZVFwq6NB1judrsUNV6T7YIcYX1eD>`__ - For enabling the 3.5mm headphone jack
