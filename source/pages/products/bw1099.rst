All DepthAI editions utilize the System on Module (SoM), which can also be used by itself to integrate into your own designs.
The SoM allows the board that carries it to be a simple, easy four-layer standard-density board, as opposed to the
high-density-integration (HDI) stackup (with laser-vias and stacked vias) required to directly integrate the VPU itself.

Getting Started Integrating Into Your Products
**********************************************

All the boards based on the DepthAI System on Module are available on Github under MIT License `here <https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-hardware>`__.

These are in Altium Designer format.
So if you use Altium Designer, you're in luck!  You can quickly/easily integrate the DepthAI SoM into your products with
proven and up-to-date designs (the same designs you can buy `here <https://shop.luxonis.com/>`__).
