OAK for Education
=================

By creating OAK devices, our goal is to make Spatial AI accessible and easy to use by anyone.
That's why we want to share some of the community projects built around it that help us in achieving our common goal.

The Cortic A.I. Toolkit is a software package that enables makers and students to learn and experiment with A.I.
algorithms on the popular Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer. Provides a gentle introduction to A.I. for
beginners while offering a lot of customization possibilities and depth perception so that users can progressively grow with it
